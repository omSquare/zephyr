Zephyr Kernel 1.14.0 (Working Draft)
####################################

We are pleased to announce the release of Zephyr kernel version 1.14.0.

Major enhancements with this release include:

* TBD

The following sections provide detailed lists of changes by component.

Security Vulnerability Related
******************************

The following security vulnerabilities (CVEs) were addressed in this release:

* Tinycrypt HMAC-PRNG implementation doesn't take the HMAC state
  clearing into account as it performs the HMAC operations, thereby using a
  incorrect HMAC key for some of the HMAC operations.
  CVE-2017-14200

* The shell DNS command can cause unpredictable results due to misuse of stack
  variables.
  CVE-2017-14201

* The shell implementation does not protect against buffer overruns resulting
  in unpredictable behavior.
  CVE-2017-14202

* We introduced Kernel Page Table Isolation, a technique for
  mitigating the Meltdown security vulnerability on x86 systems. This
  technique helps isolate user and kernel space memory by ensuring
  non-essential kernel pages are unmapped in the page tables when the CPU
  is running in the least privileged user mode, Ring 3. This is the
  fix for Rogue Data Cache Load (CVE-2017-5754).

* We also addressed these CVEs for the x86 port:

  - Bounds Check Bypass (CVE-2017-5753)
  - Branch Target Injection (CVE-2017-5715)
  - Speculative Store Bypass (CVE-2018-3639)
  - L1 Terminal Fault (CVE-2018-3620)
  - Lazy FP State Restore (CVE-2018-3665)

Documentation
*************

* Reorganized subsystem documentation into more meaningful collections
  and added or improved introductory material for each subsystem.
* Overhauled  Bluetooth documentation to split it into
  manageable units and included additional information, such as
  architecture and tooling.
* Added to and improved documentation on many minor subsystems and APIs
  including socket offloading, Ethernet management, LLDP networking,
  network architecture and overview, net shell, CoAP, network interface,
  network configuration library, DNS resolver, DHCPv4, DTS, flash_area,
  flash_mpa, NVS , settings and more.
* Introduced a new debugging guide that documents all the different
  variations of debug probes and host tools in
  one place, including which combinations are valid.
* Clarified and improved information about the west tool and its use.
* Improved development process documentation including how new features
  are proposed and tracked, and clarifying API lifecycle, issue and PR
  tagging requirements, contributing guidelines, doc guidelines,
  release process, and PR review process.
* Introduced a developer "fast" doc build option to eliminate
  the time needed to create the full kconfig option docs from a local
  doc build, saving five minutes for a full doc build.
* Made dramatic improvements to the doc build processing, bringing
  iterative local doc generation down from over two minutes to only a
  few seconds. This makes it much faster for doc developers to iteratively
  edit and test doc changes locally before submitting a PR.

  Git tree.
* Introduced simplified linking to doxygen-generated API reference
  material.

  documentation for a specific release
